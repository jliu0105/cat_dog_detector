## Introduction 
Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of artificial neural network designed to handle image data, making them ideal for image classification tasks. This project uses a CNN to classify images as either cats or dogs.

### Features 
* Binary image classification (cat or dog)
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Visualization of the model's performance
* Easy-to-use command line interface

## Requirement
* Python 3.8 +
* Numpy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn
* OpenCV

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jliu0105/cat_dog_detector.git
```
